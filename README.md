# VAddon for Meteor
This is the first time I did any coding in Java.
Very cool.
Well not me, vined-underscore, this is only here to edit one problem lmao.
# Modules
1. `ForceOP` - This reallly gives you operator on any server!! **FIXED TO (Attempt) TO SEND A COMMAND TO FORCEOP PLAYER!!** (Previously it would just close your game lol)
2. `Stay Locked` - Locks you into position.
3. `FidgetSpinner` - Makes you a fidget spinner.
4. `MultiSpinner` - Makes everyone and everything a fidget spinner. (Client side and some modes don't work on some entities)
5. `NoGravity` - The name describes what it does. (most likely won't work on any servers with a good AC)
6. `PacketLogger` - Logs every C2S or S2C packet in chat.
7. `Freeze` - Freezes time client side. (Will probably kick you after 5 min of using it)

# Commands
1. `uuid` - Sends yours or someone elses UUID. (I know this is in Meteorist already but I dont care)
2. `tps` - Sends the servers tps. (I also know this is in Meteor already but I don't care)
3. `ping` - Sends yours or someone elses ping.
4. `stats` - Sends yours or someone elses general stats.
5. `fly` - Just a simple fly command.
6. `ipeek` - Shows the contents of a shulker inside an item frame. (Made by [HoseanRC](https://github.com/HoseanRC))
